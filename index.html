           This research article focuses on comparing the effectiveness of two treatments for a 
           genetic disorder named Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a recessive disease responsible for the build-up 
           of mucus in the lungs due to a mutation within the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
           regulator). The two treatments are lung transplants and High-Frequency Chest wall Oscillation (HFCWO). 
           We find that lung transplants are more likely to have a negative impact on a patient’s life with higher 
           chances of death in the first few months after the operation, we conclude that HFCWO is more effective into 
           treating CF patients. Its practicality may not be the best as it is heavy and not very portable, but it 
           overall doesn’t include the chance of death like lung transplants, and the symptoms become more bearable to 
           live with as patients use the technique on a regular basis.

          We will discuss what CF is, and we’ll compare two types of treatments for CF, High 
          Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) and lung transplants, considering some of the 
          advantages and disadvantages of both treatments. CF was first described in 1938 when 
          the first cases were children who died of malnutrition (Brayshaw, R. by S., no date). This 
          disease causes many complications in the patients. Therefore, scientists and developers have 
          come up with various ways to help treat CF and make the symptoms more bearable to live with.

        <pre>
          Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease responsible for the build-up of mucus within the lungs 
          and the digestive system (NHS Choices, 2021). The disease is caused by a mutation within 
          the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which affects how 
          salt and water move across cells (NHS Choices, 2021). CF is a recessive disease, which means 
          that for someone to have the disease, both copies of their CFTR gene must have a mutation 
          (CF Genetics: The basics, no date). Specifically, to have the disease, one copy of the faulty 
          CFTR gene is inherited from both parents. Each parent would have one working copy and 
          one faulty copy of the gene; they are seen as carriers of the disease. This would mean the offspring of the 
          parents would have a 25% chance of inheriting the disease (Cystic fibrosis, no date).

          Statistically, around 10,800 people have CF in the UK (1 in every 2,500 babies born). Globally, 
          the disease affects roughly 100,000 people (FAQs, no date).

          ‘The median predicted age of survival for individuals with CF has increased to over 37 years’ 
          (Wickii and Edward 2010, p. 58). But as of 2023, the average life expectancy for CF patients is 
          50 years, with some patients living up to their 80’s (Cystic fibrosis itself, longer life 
          expectancy are possible factors, research suggests, 2023).

          Currently, there’s no cure for the disease, but there are treatments and therapies that allow 
          the symptoms to be more manageable to live with (NHS Choices, 2021). They include 
          medications (e.g., antibiotics for chest infections), airway clearance devices and lung 
          transplants (our focus), and some dietary advice (Cystic fibrosis, no date).

        At the University of Minnesota, researchers developed a device to replace manual chest 
        percussion therapy in 1985, where the device would help clear mucus secretions from the 
        lungs of CF patients (Respiratory health, no date). This new device was the birth of HFCWO.

        HFCWO includes an inflatable vest that’s attached to a machine. The machine mechanically 
        performs chest physical therapy by vibrating at a rapid pace. This vibrating process allows the 
        chest to loosen and thin mucus that’s trapped within the lungs. An air-pulse generator sends 
        air through a hose to the inflatable vest, allowing the vest to rapidly inflate and deflate, 
        roughly 20 times per second. This would cause the patient to cough up the mucus, due to 
        the pressure created by the vibrating vest (High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no 
        date). See Figure 1 to see the apparatus of HFCWO.

      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
        It has been found that HFCWO provides physiological mechanisms by which secretions in the lungs 
        are loosened from the airway wall and moved proximally in the respiratory tree. To 
        support this, Tomkiewicz et al. were able to demonstrate an in vitro reduction in both 
        spinnability of mucus and its viscoelasticity (a substance exhibiting both elastic and viscous 
        behaviour) properties. They found that ‘the mucus material became more fluid, and more 
        easily cleared from the airway’ (Tecklin, J., 2005). This shows that HFCWO is an effective 
        treatment for CF patients due to its ability to loosen up mucus within the lungs, allowing 
        the patients to have airways that would be less blocked than before.

        A downside to using HFCWO is its practicality. The device is heavy and not very portable. If a 
        patient were to use it by themselves, they may struggle to move it around to their desired 
        position (PPT, no date). 

        Lung transplants are where one/both lung(s) are removed from the patient through surgery 
        and are replaced with lung implants of the chosen donor(s). The donor(s) and the patient 
        need to have matching blood groups (Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date). See 
        Figure 2 to see where specific cuts are made in the lung vessels in a lung transplant.

        Figure 2. An overview of lung transplantation (Lung Transplantation, 2023).

        The main benefits of lung transplants for CF patients are an increased life expectancy and 
        a better quality of life (NHS Website, no date). It has been concluded that ‘Lung 
        transplantation will remain a cornerstone of treatment of terminal pulmonary disease in CF 
        for years to come’ (Huang W, Smith AT, Korotun M, Iacono A, Wang J, 2023). They found that 
        that ‘The median survival of Cf patients after lung transplant is 8.3 years. From this, we 
        can take that lung transplants are a vital method of treatment for patients diagnosed with 
        CF. However, 8.3 years can be considered short, so it can be debated whether lung transplants 
        are considered effective.

        The main risks of lung transplants include a high risk of dying in the first few months after 
        the operation, and that the procedure comes with surgical risks (e.g., bleeding) (Benefits and 
        risks of a lung transplant, no date). There is therefore question on whether patients would 
        opt for this method of treatment, other than HFCWO.

       <p class="ex1">
         <pre>
           HFCWO can be considered a more suitable treatment. It can make symptoms of 
           CF more bearable (High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no date), but its practicality can be 
           debatable in terms of one person handling the setup themselves (PPT, no date). Lung 
           transplants can increase a patient’s life expectancy, but vitally, the first few months of a 
           successful transplant results in higher chances of death (Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date).
