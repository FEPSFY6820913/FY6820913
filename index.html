           This research article focuses on comparing the effectiveness of two treatments for a 
           genetic disorder named Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a recessive disease responsible for the build-up 
           of mucus in the lungs due to a mutation within the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
           regulator). The two treatments are lung transplants and High-Frequency Chest wall Oscillation (HFCWO). 
           We find that lung transplants are more likely to have a negative impact on a patient’s life with higher 
           chances of death in the first few months after the operation, we conclude that HFCWO is more effective into 
           treating CF patients. Its practicality may not be the best as it is heavy and not very portable, but it 
           overall doesn’t include the chance of death like lung transplants, and the symptoms become more bearable to 
           live with as patients use the technique on a regular basis.

        <pre>
          We will discuss what CF is, and we’ll compare two types of treatments for CF, High 
          Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) and lung transplants, considering some of the 
          advantages and disadvantages of both treatments. CF was first described in 1938 when 
          the first cases were children who died of malnutrition (Brayshaw, R. by S., no date). This 
          disease causes many complications in the patients. Therefore, scientists and developers have 
          come up with various ways to help treat CF and make the symptoms more bearable to live with.

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
          Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease responsible for the build-up of mucus within the lungs 
          and the digestive system (NHS Choices, 2021). The disease is caused by a mutation within 
          the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which affects how 
          salt and water move across cells (NHS Choices, 2021). CF is a recessive disease, which means 
          that for someone to have the disease, both copies of their CFTR gene must have a mutation 
          (CF Genetics: The basics, no date). Specifically, to have the disease, one copy of the faulty 
          CFTR gene is inherited from both parents. Each parent would have one working copy and 
          one faulty copy of the gene; they are seen as carriers of the disease. This would mean the offspring of the 
          parents would have a 25% chance of inheriting the disease (Cystic fibrosis, no date).

          Statistically, around 10,800 people have CF in the UK (1 in every 2,500 babies born). Globally, 
          the disease affects roughly 100,000 people (FAQs, no date).

          ‘The median predicted age of survival for individuals with CF has increased to over 37 years’ 
          (Wickii and Edward 2010, p. 58). But as of 2023, the average life expectancy for CF patients is 
          50 years, with some patients living up to their 80’s (Cystic fibrosis itself, longer life 
          expectancy are possible factors, research suggests, 2023).

          Currently, there’s no cure for the disease, but there are treatments and therapies that allow 
          the symptoms to be more manageable to live with (NHS Choices, 2021). They include 
          medications (e.g., antibiotics for chest infections), airway clearance devices and lung 
          transplants (our focus), and some dietary advice (Cystic fibrosis, no date).

         <pre>
           HFCWO can be considered a more suitable treatment. It can make symptoms of 
           CF more bearable (High-frequency chest wall oscillation, no date), but its practicality can be 
           debatable in terms of one person handling the setup themselves (PPT, no date). Lung 
           transplants can increase a patient’s life expectancy, but vitally, the first few months of a 
           successful transplant results in higher chances of death (Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date).
