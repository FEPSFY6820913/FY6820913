          In this article, we will discuss what cystic fibrosis is, and a highly used treatment for the 
          disease, which in this case is High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (Airway Clearance Vest 
          Systems for Cystic Fibrosis, no date). Cystic Fibrosis was first described in 1938, with the first 
          cases of children who died of malnutrition (Brayshaw, R. by S., no date). This disease has 
          caused many complications in patients diagnosed with it, but over time, scientists, and 
          developers, such as Biomedical Engineers, have come up with various ways to help treat this 
          disease and make the symptoms more bearable to live with. We will also discuss lung 
          transplants, taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure 
          (NHS website, no date).

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
          Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease that is responsible for the build-up of mucus within the 
          lungs and the digestive system (NHS Choices, 2021). The disease is caused by a mutation 
          within the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which affects 
          how salt and water move in and out of the cell (NHS Choices, 2021). CF is seen as a recessive 
          disease, which means that for someone to have the disease, both copies of their CFTR gene 
          must have a mutation (CF Genetics: The basics, no date). Specifically, to have the disease, 
          you inherit one copy of the faulty CFTR gene from both of your parents. Each parent would 
          have one working copy and one faulty copy of the gene; therefore, they are seen as carriers 
          of the disease. If each parent has one faulty copy of the gene, that means that the offspring 
          has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease (Cystic fibrosis, no date).
