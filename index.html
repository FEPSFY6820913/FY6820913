          In this article, we will discuss what cystic fibrosis is, and a highly used treatment for the 
          disease, which in this case is High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (Airway Clearance Vest 
          Systems for Cystic Fibrosis, no date). Cystic Fibrosis was first described in 1938, with the first 
          cases of children who died of malnutrition (Brayshaw, R. by S., no date). This disease has 
          caused many complications in patients diagnosed with it, but over time, scientists, and 
          developers, such as Biomedical Engineers, have come up with various ways to help treat this 
          disease and make the symptoms more bearable to live with. We will also discuss lung 
          transplants, taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure 
          (NHS website, no date).

          Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease that is responsible for the build-up of mucus within the 
          lungs and the digestive system (NHS Choices, 2021). The disease is caused by a mutation 
          within the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which affects 
          how salt and water move in and out of the cell (NHS Choices, 2021). CF is seen as a recessive 
          disease, which means that for someone to have the disease, both copies of their CFTR gene 
          must have a mutation (CF Genetics: The basics, no date). Specifically, to have the disease, 
          you inherit one copy of the faulty CFTR gene from both of your parents. Each parent would 
          have one working copy and one faulty copy of the gene; therefore, they are seen as carriers 
          of the disease. If each parent has one faulty copy of the gene, that means that the offspring 
          has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease (Cystic fibrosis, no date). 

          Statistically, around 10,800 people have cystic fibrosis in the UK, which is 1 in every 2,500 
          babies born. But around the world, the disease affects roughly 100,000 people (FAQs, no date). 

          ‘The median predicted age of survival for individuals with CF has increased to over 37 
          years’ (Wickii and Edward 2010, p. 58). But as of 2023, the average life expectancy for 
          patients with CF is 50 years, with some patients living into their 80’s (Cystic fibrosis itself, 
          longer life expectancy are possible factors, research suggests, 2023).

          Currently, to this day, there is no cure for the disease, but there are treatments and therapies 
          that allow the symptoms to be more manageable to live with, and thus reduce complications 
          (NHS Choices, 2021). Possible treatments for CF include medications such as antibiotics for 
          chest infections, airway clearance devices, lung transplants (our focus), and even some 
          dietary advice (Cystic fibrosis, no date).

          This technique that is used to treat cystic fibrosis involves an inflatable vest which is 
          attached to a machine, that mechanically performs chest physical therapy by vibrating at a 
          high frequency. The vibration from the vest allows the chest to loosen and thin mucus 
          trapped within the lungs. An air-pulse generator sends air through a hose to an inflatable 
          vest, which causes the vest to rapidly inflate and deflate, at roughly 20 times per second. 
          This would lead to the patient coughing up the built-up mucus due to the pressure created 
          by the rapid inflation and deflation of the vest (High-frequency chest wall oscillation, no 
          date). 

          HFCWO was developed in 1985 when researchers at the University of Minnesota worked 
          on a therapeutic device that would replace manual chest percussion therapy to help clear 
          excess secretions from Cystic Fibrosis patients’ lungs (Respiratory health, no date).
